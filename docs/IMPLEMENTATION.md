# Implementation Notes

```haskell
```


## Style

most imports are qualified:

```haskell
import qualified "" _ as _
import           "" _      ()
```



## `base`

### `Data.Monoid`

```haskell
newtype Alt f a

-- Monoid under <|>.
```

### `Control.Exception`

```haskell
catches :: IO a -> [Handler a] -> IO a 

Sometimes you want to catch two different sorts of exception. You could do something like

>>> f = expr `catch` \ (ex :: ArithException) -> handleArith ex
>>>          `catch` \ (ex :: IOException)    -> handleIO    ex

However, there are a couple of problems with this approach. The first is that having two exception handlers is inefficient. However, the more serious issue is that the second exception handler will catch exceptions in the first, e.g. in the example above, if handleArith throws an IOException then the second exception handler will catch it.

Instead, we provide a function catches, which would be used thus:

>>> f = expr `catches` [Handler (\ (ex :: ArithException) -> handleArith ex),
>>>                     Handler (\ (ex :: IOException)    -> handleIO    ex)]
```

```haskell
data Handler a =

  Exception e => Handler (e -> IO a)	 

You need this when using catches.

```



## `containers`

```haskell
foldMapWithKey :: Monoid m => (k -> a -> m) -> Map k a -> m 
```




## `zlib`

```haskell
module Codec.Compression.GZip
```

```haskell
decompress :: ByteString -> ByteString

Decompress a stream of data in the gzip format.

There are a number of errors that can occur. In each case an exception will be thrown. The possible error conditions are:

- if the stream does not start with a valid gzip header
- if the compressed stream is corrupted
- if the compressed stream ends permaturely

Note that the decompression is performed lazily. Errors in the data stream may not be detected until the end of the stream is demanded (since it is only at the end that the final checksum can be checked). If this is important to you, you must make sure to consume the whole decompressed stream before doing any IO action that depends on it.
```

```haskell
decompressWith :: DecompressParams -> ByteString -> ByteString

Like decompress but with the ability to specify various decompression parameters. Typical usage:

>>> decompressWith defaultCompressParams { ... }
```



## `filepath`

```haskell
takeExtensions :: FilePath -> String

Get all extensions.

>>> takeExtensions "/directory/path.ext" == ".ext"
>>> takeExtensions "file.tar.gz" == ".tar.gz"
```




## `turtle`

`Shell` â‰¡ `[] + IO + Managed`

the `Shell` Embeddings:

```haskell
select ::        [a] -> Shell a
liftIO ::      IO a  -> Shell a
using  :: Managed a  -> Shell a
```

`Shell` Embeddings obey these laws. Associativity Law:

```haskell
do { x <- select m; select (f x) } = select (do { x <- m; f x })
do { x <- liftIO m; liftIO (f x) } = liftIO (do { x <- m; f x })
do { x <- with   m; using  (f x) } = using  (do { x <- m; f x })
```

and Identity Law:

```haskell
select (return x) = return x
liftIO (return x) = return x
using  (return x) = return x
```

> ... and select obeys these additional laws:

```haskell
select xs <|> select ys = select (xs <|> ys)
select empty = empty
```

### module `Text.Parser.Combinators`

```haskell

          | otherwise = sequenceA (replicate n p)
```








## `tar` package

### Example

```haskell
import qualified "tar" Codec.Archive.Tar as Tar


```

### Modules

`Codec.Archive.Tar`:

> Reading, writing and manipulating ".tar" archive files.

### Functions

#### `extract`

    extract
        :: FilePath	-- Destination directory
        -> FilePath	-- Tarball
        -> IO ()	 


>Extract all the files contained in a ".tar" file.
>
>It is equivalent to calling the standard tar program like so:

    $ tar -x -f tarball.tar -C dir


>So for example if the tarball.tar file contains foo/bar.txt then this will extract it to dir/foo/bar.txt.
>
>This is a high level "all in one" operation. Since you may need variations on this function it is instructive to see how it is written. It is just:

    Tar.unpack dir . Tar.read =<< BS.readFile tar

#### `unpack`

    unpack
        :: Exception e
        => FilePath     -- ^ Destination directory
        -> Entries e
        -> IO ()

> Create local files and directories based on the entries of a tar archive.
> 
> This is a portable implementation of unpacking suitable for portable archives. It handles NormalFile and Directory entries and has simulated support for SymbolicLink and HardLink entries. Links are implemented by copying the target file. This therefore works on Windows as well as Unix. All other entry types are ignored, that is they are not unpacked and no exception is raised.
> 
> If the Entries ends in an error then it is raised an an exception. Any files or directories that have been unpacked before the error was encountered will not be deleted. For this reason you may want to unpack into an empty directory so that you can easily clean up if unpacking fails part-way.
> 
> On its own, this function only checks for security (using checkSecurity). You can do other checks by applying checking functions to the Entries that you pass to this function. For example:

    unpack dir (checkTarbomb expectedDir entries)
    
> If you care about the priority of the reported errors then you may want to use checkSecurity before checkTarbomb or other checks.

#### `read`

    read :: ByteString -> Entries FormatError

> Convert a data stream in the tar file format into an internal data structure. Decoding errors are reported by the Fail constructor of the Entries type

#### `check*`

checks:

    unpack dir (checkTarbomb expectedDir entries)

#### `checkTarbomb`

    checkTarbomb :: FilePath -> Entries e -> Entries (Either e TarBombError)

> This function checks a sequence of tar entries for being a "tar bomb". This means that the tar file does not follow the standard convention that all entries are within a single subdirectory, e.g. a file "foo.tar" would usually have all entries within the "foo/" subdirectory.
> 
> Given the expected subdirectory, this function checks all entries are within that subdirectroy.
> 
> Note: This check must be used in conjunction with checkSecurity (or checkPortability).

### Notes

#### Compression

Compressed tar archives, via `zlib` package:

>Tar files are commonly used in conjunction with gzip compression, as in ".tar.gz" or ".tar.bz2" files. This module does not directly handle compressed tar files however they can be handled easily by composing functions from this module and the modules Codec.Compression.GZip or Codec.Compression.BZip (see zlib or bzlib packages).
>
>Creating a compressed ".tar.gz" file is just a minor variation on the create function, but where throw compression into the pipeline:

    BS.writeFile tar . GZip.compress . Tar.write =<< Tar.pack base dir


>Similarly, extracting a compressed ".tar.gz" is just a minor variation on the extract function where we use decompression in the pipeline:

    Tar.unpack dir . Tar.read . GZip.decompress =<< BS.readFile tar
